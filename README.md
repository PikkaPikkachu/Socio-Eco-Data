# Unemployment Rates 
A python script for analyzing and plotting LR models. Easy to use, just substitute your own .csv file. Yeah got that right, it's a plug-and-play thing. 

## Here's how I used it for my investigation!

### Problem Statement
What is the impact of increasing literacy rates in India on unemployment rates in states and UTs? 

### Introduction
With increasing unemployment rates, it is becoming necessary to figure out the underlying problems causing this. We are going to start by looking at the literacy rate and unemployment rate trends. We will, further, explore more features like corruption, annual growth rate, population, no. of factories and gender ratio.

We are going to be looking at state/UT data for 2011, to explore these trends. 

## Interested?
1. Clone the repository. 
2. Continue reading the trends discovered as documented in UnemploymentRates.pdf
3. Visualize the data with the plots available in Plots folder. 
4. Run and alter python script for your own LR models.
